<img src='/assets/profile.jpg' width='200' height='200' align='right' /> I am a research assistant at the Center for Natural Sciences and Environmental Research (CENSER) Systems and Computational Biology Unit of the College of Science at [De La Salle University - Manila, Philippines](https://www.dlsu.edu.ph/), under the guidance of Dr. Angelyn Lao. My research interests are Systems Biology and Mathematical modeling. I am currently part of the DOST-SEI Career Incentive Program as an MS graduate fellow.

I earned my Master's degree in Physics at De La Salle University - Manila. I am a member of the [Theoretical Physics Research Group](https://www.dlsu.edu.ph/colleges/cos/departments/physics/tprg/), under the guidance of Dr. Emmanuel Rodulfo (thesis adviser). My thesis is on ["Weak deflection angle and shadow of an extended uncertainty principle black hole with dark matter halo"](https://animorepository.dlsu.edu.ph/etdm_physics/2/). This research was published in [Annals of Physics 436 (2022):168722](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003491621003225). I received a scholarship from the [DOST-SEI ASTHRDP program](https://www.sei.dost.gov.ph/index.php/10-pap/papscholarships/66-accelerated-s-t-human-resource-development-program) for my Master's education.

I earned my Doctor of Medicine degree at [St. Luke's Medical Center College of Medicine](https://slmc-cm.edu.ph/). I was a student researcher at the [Research Management Office](https://www.facebook.com/researchmanagementoffice) of the St. Luke's Medical Center College of Medicine, under the guidance of Ms. Maria Nilda Munoz. I am a member of the [Philippine Medical Association](https://www.philippinemedicalassociation.org/) and [Manila Medical Society](https://www.facebook.com/manilamedsoc/).
